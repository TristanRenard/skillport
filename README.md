## The concept
SkillPort is fully based on one simple feature: **Create your blocks**. You can add the sections you want to create your own portfolio. You can add a title, a description, and a link to your project. You can create **YOUR** portfolio as **YOU** want.

## üßê About
This project was made by [Vincent](https://github.com/VGauthieer) , [L√©a](https://github.com/leashmt) and [Tristan](https://github.com/TristanRenard/) in 3.5 days. This project is based on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and MongoDB for the DB. We have decided to do an editor to create portfolios.
